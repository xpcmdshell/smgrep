name: rsgrep
description: Semantic code search using natural language queries. Use when users ask "where is X implemented", "how does Y work", "find the logic for Z", or need to locate code by concept rather than exact text. Returns file paths with line numbers and code snippets.

## When to Use
Use this to find code by **concept** or **behavior** (e.g., "where is auth validated", "how are plugins loaded").
*Note: This tool prioritizes finding the right files and locations in the code. Snippets are truncated (max 16 lines) and are often just previews.*

Example:
```bash
rsgrep "how are plugins loaded"
rsgrep "how are plugins loaded" packages/transformers.js/src
```

## Strategy for Different Query Types

### For **Architectural/System-Level Questions** (auth, LSP integration, file watching)
1. **Search Broadly First:** Use a conceptual query to map the landscape.
   * `rsgrep "authentication authorization checks"`
2. **Survey the Results:** Look for patterns across multiple files:
   * Are checks in middleware? Decorators? Multiple services?
   * Do file paths suggest different layers (gateway, handlers, utils)?
3. **Read Strategically:** Pick 2-4 files that represent different aspects:
   * Read the main entry point
   * Read representative middleware/util files
   * Follow imports if architecture is unclear
4. **Refine with Specific Searches:** If one aspect is unclear:
   * `rsgrep "session validation logic"`
   * `rsgrep "API authentication middleware"`

### For **Targeted Implementation Details** (specific function, algorithm)
1. **Search Specifically:** Ask about the precise logic.
   * `rsgrep "logic for merging user and default configuration"`
2. **Evaluate the Semantic Match:**
   * Does the snippet look relevant?
   * **Crucial:** If it ends in `...` or cuts off mid-logic, **read the file**.
3. **One Search, One Read:** Use rsgrep to pinpoint the best file, then read it fully.

## Output Format

Returns: `path/to/file:line [Tags] Code Snippet`

- `[Definition]`: Semantic search detected a class/function here. High relevance.
- `...`: **Truncation Marker**. Snippet is incomplete—use `read_file` for full context.

## Tips

- **Trust the Semantics:** You don't need exact names. `rsgrep "how does the server start"` works better than guessing `rsgrep "server.init"`.
- **Watch for Distributed Patterns:** If results span 5+ files in different directories, the feature is likely architectural—survey before diving deep.
- **Scope When Possible:** Use path constraints to focus: `rsgrep "auth" src/server/`
- **Don't Over-Rely on Snippets:** For architectural questions, snippets are signposts, not answers. Read the key files.
- **"Still Indexing...":** If you see this, please stop, alert the user that the index is ongoing and ask them if they wish to proceed. Results will be partial until the index is complete.
